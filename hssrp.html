        This paper investigates the journey of laws in Malaysia combatting disinformation, and how these laws have evolved in the face of political context. It also aims to shed light on how future anti-fake news laws could be improved to better satisfy their aim and passed without public outrage. Our research uses qualitative data collected from the expert interviewees and review of literature, where we made use of thematic analysis. Our findings suggest that with the implementation of non-legal countermeasures, as well as the suitable political and societal conditions, legal countermeasures are more likely to be successfully implemented, to combat disinformation.
