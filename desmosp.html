      <p class="big">
        The mall pop-out on the “pandemic” side shows people observing social distancing and wearing masks.
        Comparatively, the HDB pop-outs on the “endemic” side include people maskless, standing close together, as well as large group gatherings.
        While the HDB pop-out on the “pandemic” side shows an advisory to stay home [hence HBL and WFH],
        the pop-outs on the “endemic” side show people going outdoors.
        This portrays the lifting of measures such as social distancing, mandatory mask wearing and small group gatherings.
      </p>
      <p class="big">
        As portrayed in hotel pop-outs, instead of being isolated in a room after receiving the Quarantine Order [Q.O.]
        during the “pandemic”, people go to hotels for staycations during the “endemic”.
        In contrast to the grounded plane on the “pandemic” side,
        the plane on the “endemic” side carried passengers overseas for a vacation.
        This depicts the reopening of the borders of many countries, transitioning from “pandemic to endemic”,
        allowing for travelling and staycations as the virus is now “permanent in the community” and people live with it.
